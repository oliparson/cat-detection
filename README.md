# cat-detection

This repository collects my attempts to train a machine learning algorithm to detect whether my cat is in the house using only camera images.

You can read about my progress on the [Non-intrusive Cat Monitoring blog](https://nonintrusivecatmonitoring.blogspot.com/).

The script `upload_photo.sh` takes a photo, saves it to the `~/Pictures/` directory and uploads it to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
